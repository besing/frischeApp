### A React Native iOS App for a local food-delivery startup
### M.A. Thesis of Benjamin Singer at HAW Hamburg, 2017

"FrischeApp" (translates to "FreshApp") is an iOS App developed for easy handling of a returnable article process. It connects to Shopware 5, a popular E-Commerce Platform, via their provided Web-API.

For learning reasons and out of interest in cutting edge technology, the Native App was realized through Facebook's React Native Framework. The project had a tight schedule, the complete coding until the first running MVP-like version took around one month.

The current state of development is highly considered as Beta.
